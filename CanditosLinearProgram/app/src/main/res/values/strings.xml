    <string name="bench_instructions">To perform this movement, lay down flat on a bench under a barbell. Use a rack for your own safety. Begin by retracting your shoulders, keeping your back tight, feet on the floor and grab the barbell with an overhand grip. Unrack the weight, lower the barbell to your chest, once you touch your chest, push the weight back up. This is one rep. Consider using a spotter if you\'re lifting heavy weight.</string>

This is one rep. Consider using a spotter if you\'re lifting heavy weight.</string>
